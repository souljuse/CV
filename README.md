Passionate about games, tech, music and international politics, I had a hard time finding my way, but I had no more doubts when I started coding. After two degrees in International Relations, an experience in a Web Agency as a SEO specialist and a job as an occasional freelance front-end developer I decided to go full-stack by enrolling at Makers Academy, a highly selective bootcamp focused on Ruby development.

After this experience I was hired by a Florence based web agency, Cantiere Creativo.
There I had the chance to deepen my knowledge of both Rails and Javascript, to learn new frameworks, like React JS to build static sites from scratch using generators like Gatsby JS and Middleman, and to develop new skills like dealing with clients and doing real work for demanding clients.

After a year I started working for an internal project called DatoCMS, that now has become a full-grown tech giant, one of the leading headless content management systems.
I had to work both on the app's frontend (React + Redux) and the backend (Ruby on Rails), and on numerous related projects, like the API client. I am so proud!

#### Languages #2

In addition to Italian, my mother language, I speak fluent English and some French,
plus I have a basic knowledge of Spanish and German. I lived and worked in London, Paris and Berlin.

#### Problem solving

Along with my natural predisposition and passion for solving logical and
mathematical problems, my years as an International Relations student,
a multidisciplinary degree, have thought me how to use different strategies to different contexts.
Plus I realized that I could pick up new concepts with ease and quickly adapt to any new subject or situation.

## Me

#### What I love about coding (on how Irene found one more passion)

I found a pattern in what led me to learn coding and I think that it tells a lot about who I am.

These are my consolidated passions

1. I love logic games, crosswords and quizzes. I found them relaxing and fun
2. I like creating stories and worlds, I play RPGs a lot, pen & paper, video games and I organise Larp events.
   That has something to do with my academic background, international relations and politics, i.e. from my interests in social textures, rules governing world politics that are not written in formal rules.
3. I make electronic music. What I love about that is that, after years of playing in a band,
   I could finally have control on a song, compose it and shape entirely.
   Focusing on what I like the most about composing, the soundscape.. That final feeling of the song.
4. I like puzzles and building stuff

Being a developer fits perfectly to this profile. I found a little bit of all the aforementioned aspects in coding:

1. First, logic, love that, could work (play?) with it for hours.
2. Creating worlds has similarities to coding. Every time you deal with a new project you get to explore a new world with its rules -the technologies and languages- and landscapes -the looks.
3. Creativity & control: even in team projects coding allows you to have control on a part of the code.
   Allowing you to be creative and to make something beautiful that you can be proud of.
4. In a completely opposite manner to how I keep my room, I like to build organised code and like refactoring code to make it more efficient.
