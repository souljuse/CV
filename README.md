Passionate about games, tech, music and international politics, I had a hard time finding my way, but I had no more doubts when I started coding.
After two degrees in International Relations, an experience in a Web Agency as a SEO specialist and a job as an occasional freelance front-end developer I decided to go full-stack by enrolling at Makers Academy, a highly selective bootcamp focused on Ruby development.

I learned TDD/BDD, programming languages like Ruby, Javascript and basics of Python, web application frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Django and Meteor and testing frameworks such as RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine.

Thanks to my problem solving skills, will to learn new things everyday and flexible thinking I am able to adapt very quickly to each of all new environments and challenges and that proved to work also in development as I was able to create a Python/Django project in one week, even though I had never seen such framework before.

I'm currently looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role in an organisation that is passionate about creating creative solutions and innovation and have a positive approach to work.

## Me

#### What I love about code (how Irene found one more passion)
I found a pattern in what led me to learn coding and I think that it tells a lot about who I am.

These are my consolidated passions
1. I love logic games, crosswords, puzzles and quizzes. I found them relaxing and fun
2. I like creating stories and worlds, I play RPGs a lot, pen & paper, video games and I even organise Larp events. That has something to do with my academic background, international relations and politics. My choice to enroll in  came from my interests in social textures, rules governing world politics that are not written in formal rules.
3. I make electronic music. what I love about that is that, after years of playing in a band, I could finally have control on a song, compose it and shape entirely. Focusing on what I like the most about composing, the soundscape.. that final feeling of the song.

Being a developer fits perfectly to this profile. I found a little bit of all the aforementioned aspects in coding:
1. First, logic, love that, could work (play?) with it for hours.
2. Creating worlds: it's something you do when you create a program, create a new world with its rules. At the same time I enjoy also understanding and eventually work on other’s people rules system, finding logical patterns and trying to fit in.
3. Creativity & control: even in team projects coding allows you to have control on a part of the code. Allowing you to be creative and to make something beautiful that you can be proud of.

Plus, in a completely opposite manner to how I keep my room, I like to keep write organised and efficient way, and that reflects in my style of coding. You can see that by all the bullet points lists I use.
